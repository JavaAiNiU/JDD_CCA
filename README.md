The datasets used in this article are [Sony](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G6VruemZtpOyHjOC5N8Ww3ftVXOydSXx/view) and [MCR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q3NYGyByNnEKt_mREzD2qw9L2TuxCV_r/view), and the code will be open source after acceptance.

# Pretrained model

The pre trained model will be open sourced after the paper is received.

# Grateful

 Part of the code in this warehouse is written with reference to [SID](https://github.com/cchen156/Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark) and [RetinexRawMamba](https://github.com/Cynicarlos/RetinexRawMamba). We are very grateful for their open source help!
